A start at making a First Person View Mod for Plateup (Workshop)

Current Features:
- First Person Camera
- Minimap Overhead
- TFGH FPS style movement
- Mouse input for camera movement


Issues:
- Can't access UI
- Player Rotation rotates full body instead of just head. 
- Clipping through objects when too close.
- Basic Skybox applied as some levels are black.
