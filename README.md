A start at making a First Person View Mod for Plateup (Workshop)

Controls:

F1: Activate
W: Move Forward
A: Strafe Left
S: Move Back
D: Strafe Right
Mouse: Control Camera


Current Features:
- First Person Camera
- Minimap Overhead
- WASD FPS style movement
- Mouse input for camera movement


Issues:
- Can't access UI
- Player Rotation rotates full body instead of just head. 
- Clipping through objects when too close.
- Basic Skybox applied as some levels are black.
- F1 Doesn't toggle to the camera and just creates a new one everytime
- Controller not working
- unable to move before toggled
- Camera rotates out of the map and needs to be clamped
- camera needs to be clamped at the right height to allow interaction
- Camera breaks when each new internal scene is rendered resulting in a NoClip bug


Upcoming:
- rebind interaction to mouse keys
- Move UI over FPV camera 
- Minimap to follow player
